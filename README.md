AVMIS refers to "Ansar VDP Management Information System" which is to guarantee the safety and security of rural areas in Bangladesh by recruiting locals to assist in crime prevention and law enforcement.

In their current state, the registration procedure for VDP is done manually. It is so difficult to recruit a large number of people manually during urgent needs. To address these issues, we are recommending a new automated VDP system. The proposed system will have
 - Finding Eligibility & Availability of Registration
 - VDP self registration through recruitment site
 - VDP registration through AVMIS system
 - Registration Verification & Approval
 - Short Term Deployment Management
 - Training Interest & Management
 - Certificate Issue & Verification System (CIVS)
 - Verify Ansar VDP integration w/ citizen portal
 - Additional Information and Document Update
 - MIS Report
 - Configuration
 - Check VDP Status (public portal)
